### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, we made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. We imported the data and answered some questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. We also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
